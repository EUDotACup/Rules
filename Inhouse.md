# Inhouse Rules

Inhouses are first and foremost to have fun. With that in mind we want to keep the rules to a bare minimum, but we also want to ensure everyone will be able to enjoy it.

## Registration
* Inhouses are run using FaceIt, so you need a FaceIt account.
* Click this link to join our hub: https://www.faceit.com/en/hub/6374f8e9-9bca-432b-b114-d7787b79f3f0/EU%20Inhouse%20League
* Use the "play" button to queue up at any time!
* Join our Discord server here: http://discord.gg/MvUhFuy

## Lobby
* You will get invited to a lobby by a lobby bot.
* Generally whoever is the captain in the FaceIt lobby should be the captain/drafter ingame, unless your team agrees otherwise.

## In Game
* All chat is allowed, but keep it civil.
* Toxic behaviour is not tolerated, not in chat and especially not in voice chat. There may be a huge skill disparity between players - keep that in mind should you feel the urge to flame someone.
* Excessive toxicity will get you banned from playing inhouses after one warning.
* Games are played in Captains Mode, communication with your team is mandatory, ingame as well as during the drafting stage.
* In case of disconnects or technical problems, pause the game. Up to 10min of pause time should be granted.
* Should someone get disconnected for longer / leave the game: If there was First Blood and it's after 5:00 min the game counts.

## General
* Basic understanding of the english language is required.
* Dodging games based on player draft or other preferences is not allowed.

Should there be problems of any kind, ideas, or feedback please leave a message in the #suggestion_box on our Discord or message us directly.
