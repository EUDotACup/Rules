# Inhouse Rules

Inhouses are first and foremost to have fun. With that in mind we want to keep the rules to a bare minimum, but we also want to ensure everyone will be able to enjoy it.

## Registration
* Inhouses are run using FaceIt, so you need a FaceIt account.
* Click this invite link to join our hub: https://www.faceit.com/en/inv/6pYyOPO
* Use the "play" button to queue up at any time!
* Join our Discord server here to communicate with your team: http://discord.gg/MvUhFuy

## Lobby
* You will get invited to a lobby by a lobby bot.
* Generally whoever is the captain in the FaceIt lobby should be the captain/drafter ingame, unless your team agrees otherwise.

## In Game
* All chat is allowed, but keep it civil.
* Toxic behaviour is not tolerated, not in chat and especially not in voice chat. There may be a huge skill disparity between players - keep that in mind should you feel the urge to flame someone.
* Excessive toxicity will get you banned from playing inhouses after one warning.
* Games are played in Captains Mode, communication with your team is mandatory, ingame as well as during the drafting stage.

Should there be problems of any kind, ideas, or feedback please leave a message in the #suggestion_box on our Discord or message us directly.
