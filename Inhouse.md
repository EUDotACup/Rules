# Inhouse Rules

## Registration
* No registration needed. Inhouses are run on a first come first served basis. Lobbies will be created at the specified times and announced in the #Inhouse channel on our Discord. The first 10 players to join get to play
* Having played in one inhouse does not guarantee you a spot in the next one.

## In Game
* All chat is allowed, but keep it civil.
* Toxic behaviour is not tolerated, not in chat and especially not in voice chat. There will be a huge skill disparity between players - keep that in mind should you feel the urge to flame someone.
* Excessive toxicity will get you banned from playing inhouses after one warning.
