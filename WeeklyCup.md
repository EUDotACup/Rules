# Weekly Cup Rules

## Registration
* Everyone is able to register for the cup. There are no MMR limits or other restrictions, as long as you adhere to the rules.
* You may only register with one team and one account.
* To register every player on your team must have public match data exposed. This is needed so we can seed your team correctly and provide the most balanced tournament experience possible.
* If you signup but do not turn up for the cup without notice you will be banned from participating for the following two weeks.

## Teams
* At any point before the cup you can swap out players in your team.
* Standins are allowed, but have to be approved. Their MMR can't be higher than the MMR of the player they replace + 500.

## Lobby
* Lobbies are ticketed and will be created by the admin team only.
* The lower seeded team will call the coin toss.

## In Game

* Each team has 10 minutes of pause time per game.
* Teams who are late will get -60 sec reserve time for 10 min, forfeit for 15min.
